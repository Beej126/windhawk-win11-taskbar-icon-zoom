# Windows 11 Taskbar Icon Zoom

Adds a magnification effect to Windows 11 taskbar icons when hovered, similar to the
macOS Dock. When you hover over taskbar icons, they'll smoothly enlarge along with
nearby icons to create a fluid magnification effect.

Customize the magnification amount and range in the settings.

Only Windows 11 is supported.
Tested on Version 24H2 (OS Build 26100.4652)
